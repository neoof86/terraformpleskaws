# Plesk Built by Terraform on AWS
## Disclaimer:- This script will not be covered fully by the AWS Free Tier (At time of edit) as it uses the NAT Gateway and VPC. I am not liable for any charges to that you incur. I saw this and this blog here also explains it http://vadivel.blogspot.com/2016/12/how-i-got-billed-even-though-i-had.html
## I also have to thank Mohamed Labouardy over on this blog as his base code helped me along with what we were doing at work https://hackernoon.com/manage-aws-vpc-as-infrastructure-as-code-with-terraform-55f2bdb3de2a

### Getting up and running
For this you will need an AWS account and as above you will incur charges, if you want a cheaper option looks at AWS Lightsail. I did try this with Terraform but you can not automate the firewall when I last edited this code 

I have done a demo video here https://youtu.be/fj9sSuNeMN8

### Things I would like to add
- [X] Get the inital code online
- [X] Get the inital video online
- [ ] Get the Plesk admin URL emailed or on a hidden page for faster deployments
- [ ] Allow for multiple projects with varibles and state files accordingly
